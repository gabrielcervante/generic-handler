# gin-handler

This is a generic Gin and Fiber Handler, what it means?

When you are working with gin or fiber you need to declare in a route a function to handle your route and most of the time it is not necessary because we don't use logic in this handlers so what we need is just to declare in a handler an unmarshall to our json and send to our function that will really make something.

It is something that just takes time and most of the time is boilerplate code so for these and some other reasons I've decided to create it for my use and others whitch need something simple to use.

WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE FOLDER WITH EXAMPLES TO MAKE IT CLEARER.
